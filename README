madhouse-rs (mh-rs)

WHAT IT DOES
-----------

mh-rs tests systems through command sequences that mutate state:

                 +-------+
                 | State |
                 +-------+
                     ^
                     |
+---------+     +----+----+     +-----------+
| Command | --> | check() | --> |  apply()  |
+---------+     +---------+     | [asserts] |
                                +-----------+
     ^                                |
     |                                v
+----------+                     +--------+
| Strategy |                     | State' |
+----------+                     +--------+

Commands do three things: check preconditions, apply state changes, and verify
correctness. No more forgetting to check edge cases.


FEATURES
-------
- Trait-based design that actually forces you to think about state.
- Commands validate themselves - no more half-assed tests.
- Works in both deterministic and random testing modes.
- Shows execution time so you know what's slow.
- Ability to shrink test cases when it finds bugs.


USAGE
-----
For detailed usage, check the source code which contains comprehensive
examples and tests.


EXECUTION MODES
--------------
- DEFAULT MODE: Commands execute in the order you specified
- SHUFFLE MODE: Commands run in random order (set MADHOUSE=1)

Use shuffle mode to find bugs, deterministic mode to run scenarios.
